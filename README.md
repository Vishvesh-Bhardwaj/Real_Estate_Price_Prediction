This is my Machine Learning project on real estate price prediction model. I first used linear regression to build a model using the Bangalore House Prices dataset from Kaggle.com. Then next step would be to build a Python Flask server that uses the stored model to handle http requests. The third component is creating a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the User Interface, once the user submits the details about their required House type that is - square foot, bedrooms, bathrooms etc.,the python flask server at the backend would display the estimated price. Many machine learning techniques are addressed during this model creation process, including data loading, pre-processing and cleaning, outlier identification and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and k fold cross validation.


**In terms of technology and tools, this project addresses :

**+ Python - programming language
**+ Numpy and pandas - for data cleaning
**+ Matplotlib - for data visualisation
**+ Sklearn - for model building
**+ Jupyter Notebbok, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code  - IDE
**+ Python Flask - for http server
**+ HTML, CSS, JavaScript - for User Interface
